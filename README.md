# Wealth Health - HRnet

Wealth Health HRnet is a HR app based on React JS where the user can add and manage its employees. The data are stored in a persistent Redux State.

By default, no data is present: you have to create a user by yourself. The redux state is persisted and saved in the client's local storage.

This project is part of the Openclassrooms program "Javascript/React application developer" (project #14).
